## What is SkyBlock Core?

SkyBlock Core is a centralized mod for SkyBlock settings, menus, localization, events, and more. It serves as a foundation for other SkyBlock mods by providing essential functionality and features. With SkyBlock-Core, you can easily build and extend your own SkyBlock experience.
